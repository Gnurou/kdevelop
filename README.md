KDevelop kernel support staging branch
======================================

This branch contains all changes that are being developed/staged in order to improve Linux kernel support in KDevelop, but are not merged upstream yet.

Installation
------------
You will need kdevplatform (v1.7.0) and compile kdevelop from this repository by yourself (only Git versions supported for now):

http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDevelop4/HowToCompile

However, instead of cloning the official KDevelop repository, clone this one and checkout and compile the `kernel` branch. Then download, compile and install the `kdev-kernel` plugin:

More to come...
